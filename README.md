# Financials-Dashboard
This repository contains a Financial Dataset and an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide valuable insights into various sales and financial metrics. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators such as total sales by country, total sales by segment, sales by discount band, and total sales by product, along with additional summary metrics like total sales, total margin, total COGS, profit %, and average order value.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive tool for sales and financial analysis, allowing users to analyze data across multiple dimensions and track important sales metrics efficiently.
